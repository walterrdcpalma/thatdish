# Product Context

We are building a mobile-first app where food is discovered through signature dishes.

This is NOT a traditional restaurant discovery platform.

The focus is on:

- Individual dishes
- Visual identity
- Simplicity
- Small local restaurants as well as high-end places

Every restaurant can have:

- One signature dish
- Optional additional dishes

Users interact with dishes, not with restaurants.

Core ideas:

- Users can create restaurants that do not yet exist
- Users can upload dish photos
- Restaurants can later claim ownership
- Ownership allows them to manage their signature dish

Until ownership exists:

- The signature is determined by community engagement (likes)

After ownership:

- The owner can change the signature dish
- Previous signatures remain in history

We optimize for:

- Simplicity
- Low friction onboarding for small restaurants
- Visual-first discovery

We are NOT building:

- A review-heavy platform
- A social network
- A booking system

The product must remain minimal.
Avoid feature creep.
Always prioritize clarity and speed.
