# Commit messages

When generating or suggesting commit messages (e.g. for git commits):

- **Maximum length: 200 characters** for the entire message (subject + body if present, or subject only).
- Prefer a short, clear subject line under 72 characters when possible; only extend up to 200 if needed.
- If the user asks for a commit message, ensure the output does not exceed 200 characters in total.
